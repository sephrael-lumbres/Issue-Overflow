# Issue Overflow

## Description
This application allows software development teams to track reported bugs, assigned tasks, feature requests, and more.

Users can create issues and categorize them with fields such as description, issue type, priority, status, due date, and an estimated number of hours needed to resolve the issue.
Users can also attach files, add comments, and assign another user to an issue.
* The Description is a rich-text field where you would describe or summarize what the issue entails. 
* The Type field categorizes the issues into the following four types: "Bug", "Task", "Request", and "Other". 
* The Priority field describes how urgently the issue needs to be completed.
* The Status field describes how far along the issue is from being completed. 
  * "Open" means the issue has not been worked on yet.
  * "In Progress" means the issue is currently being worked on.
  * "Resolved" means the issue has been fixed.
  * "Closed" means that the issue has been reviewed, tested, and completed.
