Add New Filter Fields for Issues and More

- Add filter for 'Created By' and Unassigned Issues
- The 'View Issue' page now displays the Issue ID/Key
- Add file for commit message drafts



Fix LocalDateTime Bug and More

- Fix bug where date and time were not able to be saved into 1 variable
(previously had to use two variables, one for date and one for time)
- Fix bug where LocalDateTime was only saving the Date (because in
application.properties 'spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update' did not
let me change existing column type from DATE to DATETIME)
- Now 'Issue' only has one variable each that holds both the date AND
time for dateCreated and dateUpdated
- Now 'Comment' only has one variable that holds both the date AND time
for dateCreated
- Add connection between 'Issue' and 'Organization'
- Update Comment controller URL paths when creating and deleting a
comment to support the URL change to include Issue ID (i.e. IST-1)
- Made some JSON changes
